            <b>Introduction</b>
        
    </h2>
    <p>
        My name is JOSEPH MUTYABA.<br /> I'm a Ugandan, male and  a resident in Kampala the capital of <br/>
         Uganda.
        The earliest years of my life were spent in a Village in Lwengo district called Kabulasokke.<br/>
        While there, i was groomed and raised up as a strong and cradle Catholic, with strict adherence to<br/>
         the teaching of our Lord Jesus the Sovereign Christ.
        <br /><br />
        It was in this very place that I received the three great sacramnts of Baptism, Penance and my first <br/>
        "Holy Communion."
        <br />After this, at the age of ten, I was brought by mum to come and stay in Kampala.<br/> 
        In total I spent 9 years in Lwengo and the rest in different parts of Kampala.
